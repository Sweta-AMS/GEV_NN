Code and Trained Model
This repository contains code for reproducing the results in "Paper-Fast-parameter-estimation-of-Generalized-Extreme-Value-distribution-using-Neural-Networks" 

We have tried to describe the method used in the manuscript here along with providing the Python notebook  The code in this repository is made available primarily for reproducibility purposes, and we encourage readers seeking to use the training NN model "" to estimate the parameter of the GEV distribution for inference for large dataset to obtain a computation speedup and could use the bootstrap CI for the same thing. 

Python Interface:
One could use google colab to get started with the code, link is available here.
